Response codes
OK 200
The request was fulfilled

Bad request 400
The request had bad syntax or was inherently impossible to be satisfied.

Unauthorized 401
The parameter to this message gives a specification of authorization 
schemes which are acceptable. The client should retry the request with 
a suitable Authorization header.

PaymentRequired 402
The parameter to this message gives a specification of charging 
schemes acceptable. The client may retry the request 
with a suitable ChargeTo header.

Forbidden 403
The request is for something forbidden. Authorization will not help.

Internal Error 500
The server encountered an unexpected condition which 
prevented it from fulfilling the request.


Gateway timeout 503 (TO BE DISCUSSED)
This is equivalent to Internal Error 500, 
but in the case of a server which is in turn accessing some other service,
 this indicates that the respose from the other 
service did not return within a time that the gateway was prepared 
to wait. As from the point of view of the clientand the HTTP
transaction the other service is hidden within the server, 
this maybe treated identically to Internal error 500, 
but has more diagnostic value.
